## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Canteen Flow on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   **[Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: Required for the Django backend.
-   **[Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: Includes npm, required for the React frontend.
-   **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**: For cloning the repository.

---

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sushil930/canteen-flow.git
    cd canteen-flow
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` directory (same level as `manage.py`).
    - Copy the contents from the [Backend Environment Variables](#backend-backendenv) section below into this file and fill in your actual credentials. For local development, you can use placeholder values for Razorpay keys initially if you don't need real payment processing.

6.  **Run database migrations and create a superuser:**
    This will set up your local SQLite database and create an admin user for the Django admin panel.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

---

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory:**
    If you are currently in the `backend` directory, go back one level:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root (same level as `package.json`).
    - Copy the contents from the [Frontend Environment Variables](#frontend-envlocal) section below and update the values. The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to your running local backend (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`).

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server (in the `backend/` directory):**
    Ensure your Python virtual environment is activated.
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.
    The Django Admin panel will be at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server (in the project root directory):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if 8080 is busy).

---

## üîê Environment Variables

Environment variables are crucial for configuring sensitive information and deployment-specific settings. **Never commit your `.env` or `.env.local` files to Git!** They should only be present in your local development environment or production server.

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
```env
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True

# Database Credentials (for local PostgreSQL or production Supabase)
# For local development with SQLite, these are not strictly necessary unless you switch DB
DB_NAME=canteenflow_db
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# Razorpay API Keys (obtained from your Razorpay dashboard)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_yourkeyid
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

# Allowed Hosts (for Django security, include all domains that can access your backend)
ALLOWED_HOSTS='127.0.0.1,localhost,canteen-backend-17px.onrender.com'

# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST=http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173,https://canteen-flow.vercel.app
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=False
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=True
```

### Frontend (`.env.local`)
```env
# Base URL for your backend API (update this for production deployments)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api

# Your public Razorpay Key ID for the frontend (used to initialize Razorpay checkout)
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_yourkeyid
```

> **Important Security Note:**
> - For production deployments, always set `DEBUG=False` in your backend `.env`.
> - Update `DB_*` variables in production to point to your live PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase credentials).
> - Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is a long, random, and unique string for production.
> - `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` should precisely list only the domains your frontend will be deployed on.

---

## üö¢ Deployment

Canteen Flow is designed for independent deployment of its frontend and backend components.

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL is used in production, with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) being the recommended hosting provider for its ease of setup and integration.

-   **Backend (Django REST Framework)**:
    -   **Platforms**: Deploy to cloud platforms like [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
    -   **Web Server**: Use a production-grade WSGI server like [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) or [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
    -   **Environment**: Crucially, set `DEBUG=False` and configure all production environment variables (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DB_*` credentials, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`) on your chosen platform.

-   **Frontend (React/Vite)**:
    -   **Platform**: Deployed on **Vercel** for its excellent performance and developer experience with React applications. You can access the live frontend application here: [https://canteen-flow.vercel.app/](https://canteen-flow.vercel.app/)
    -   **Build Process**: Run `npm run build` to create a production-ready build of your frontend in the `dist/` directory.
    -   **Configuration**: Ensure that the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable on your frontend hosting platform points to the live URL of your deployed backend API.

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions when setting up or running the Canteen Flow project:

-   **`400 Bad Request` or `DisallowedHost` Error:**
    -   **Cause**: Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting does not include the domain/IP from which you are accessing the backend.
    -   **Solution**: In `backend/canteen_project/settings.py`, ensure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes `'127.0.0.1'`, `'localhost'`, and your deployed backend's domain (e.g., `'canteen-backend-17px.onrender.com'`).

-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Errors (`blocked by CORS policy`)**: 
    -   **Cause**: Your frontend (running on one origin, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) is trying to access your backend (running on another origin, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`), and the backend is not configured to allow requests from the frontend's origin.
    -   **Solution**: In `backend/canteen_project/settings.py`, verify that `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` contains the exact URLs of your frontend development server (`http://localhost:8080`, `http://127.0.0.1:5173`) and your deployed frontend (e.g., `https://canteen-flow.vercel.app`). Also ensure `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` is `True` and `CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS` includes necessary headers like `Content-Type` and `Authorization`.

-   **`TypeError: Failed to fetch` (Frontend Console Error)**:
    -   **Cause**: The frontend failed to connect to the backend API. This could be due to the backend server not running, an incorrect `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your frontend's `.env.local` (or production environment variables), or a persistent CORS issue.
    -   **Solution**: 
        1.  Ensure your backend server is running (`python manage.py runserver`).
        2.  Double-check `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env.local` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`).
        3.  Review CORS settings as described above.

-   **Missing Environment Variables**: 
    -   **Cause**: The application cannot find required environment variables (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`).
    -   **Solution**: Ensure you have created the `.env` (backend) and `.env.local` (frontend) files and populated them with all required variables as detailed in the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section.

-   **`ModuleNotFoundError` (Python Backend)**: 
    -   **Cause**: A Python package listed in `requirements.txt` is not installed or your virtual environment is not activated.
    -   **Solution**: Activate your virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

-   **Ports Already In Use**: 
    -   **Cause**: Another process is already using port `8000` (backend) or `8080` (frontend).
    -   **Solution**: You can specify different ports when starting the servers:
        -   Backend: `python manage.py runserver 8001`
        -   Frontend: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`
        Remember to update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your frontend `.env.local` if you change the backend port.

## üîó API Overview

Canteen Flow provides a comprehensive RESTful API for all its functionalities. While a dedicated API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) is planned, you can explore the available endpoints through Django REST Framework's browsable API.

Once your backend server is running locally, access the main API root at:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/)

From there, you can navigate through the different endpoints for users, canteens, menu items, orders, and payments.
